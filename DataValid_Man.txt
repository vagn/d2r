.SH NAME

d2r_DataValid \- validates data

.SH SYNOPSIS

d2r_DataValid  [ options ] [ args ]

.SH DESCRIPTION

Validates data sent from either a generator or actual output from a
temperature sensor. Data is validated in several different aspects. The
temperature is checked to make sure it outputs a temperature between
-50 C and 80 C as that is the minimum and maximum temperature allowed
by the sensor, though for practical reasons those temperatures may be
reduced to a more reasonable gauge seeing as how the circuit measures room
temperatures. The humidity should also be a number between 1-100.The time
is also checked to make sure it comes after the previous recorded time
but no more than 2 or 3 seconds after. Any variance in these conditions
will lead to removal of the data from the structure as a whole.

-SH See Also

d2r_DataGen for data format.
